# Contributing to RhinoScriptSyntax

Contributions are welcome! :raised_hands:

A couple things to note...

* The goal of RhinoScriptSyntax is to be familiar to users migrating from RhinoScript. Please keep that in mind when suggesting changes.
* As you might have noticed we have different branches for each release-stream of Rhino; service releases (`rhino-6.16`, etc.), internal Rhino 6 builds (`rhino-6.x`) and rhino WIP (`rhino-7.x`)\*. If in doubt, use the default branch!
* If you're thinking of embarking on a big feature, please talk to us first ([Discourse](https://discourse.mcneel.com/c/scripting) is best). 
* Check the existing Python-related issues on [YouTrack](https://mcneel.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issues?q=%23RH%20%23%7BSDK:%20Python%7D%20sort%20by:%20State%20)

_\* Correct at the time of writing this!_
